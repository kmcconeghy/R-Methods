# ggplot2 Examples

```{r packages, include=F, echo=F}
require("tidyverse", quietly=T, warn.conflicts = F)
require("Hmisc", quietly=T, warn.conflicts = F)
require("Scotty", quietly=T, warn.conflicts = F)
mu <- markupSpecs$html  
```

## Introduction  

In this chapter we are evaluating R's capability to compute different kinds of standard errors. Like with many things, R has extensive flexibility here but can be daunting when you want a quick option. To bring this flexibility down to earth, I lay out the background, provide practical recommendations, user-written commands and benchmark to STATA.  

### Packages to use  
`r mu$session(cite=F)`  

"Scotty" is my own package. "tidyverse" is Wickam et al. general suite of packages/commands to work with R. "Hmisc" is Frank Harrel's miscellaneous commands, many of which are quite useful.
