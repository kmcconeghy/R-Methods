# Preface   

## Introduction  
  This book contains a collection of working papers covering various statistical, analytical or causal inference problems using R statistical software.[@R-base] It is a work-in-progress and meant as a personal reference tool, but freely open to the public. Enjoy!  

  Depending on the chapter many packages may be loaded into the environment. "Scotty" is my own package many of the functions are discussed in the text. "tidyverse" is Wickam et al. general suite of packages/commands to work with R. "Hmisc" is Frank Harrel's miscellaneous commands, many of which are quite useful. Other packages may be loaded as needed for a specific chapter.  
  
  My knowledge in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, causal inference, and econometrics comes primarily from graduate work, ongoing research and personal interest.[@angrist2008mostly]
