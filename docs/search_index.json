Enjoy! Depending on the chapter many packages may be loaded into the environment. “Scotty” is my own package many of the functions are discussed in the text. “tidyverse” is Wickam et al. general suite of packages/commands to work with R. “Hmisc” is Frank Harrel’s miscellaneous commands, many of which are quite useful. Other packages may be loaded as needed for a specific chapter. My knowledge in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, causal inference, and econometrics comes primarily from graduate work, ongoing research and personal interest.(Angrist and Pischke 2008) References "],

However, perhaps you are more interesting in analyzing group-level changes over time. In order to do this, you need to reshape and summarize these individual records into counts in a “panel” dataset. In this new dataset structure I want each row to be a unique time- group- summary of the data. Some extensions of this include computing incidence (no. events per 1000 persons) and incidence density (no. events per 1000 person-years) measures. I will go through some examples and show how these datasets and measures can be constructed from person or observation unit-level data, assuming you had cohort entry-dates (i.e. admission), event dates (the date of some thing you wish to quantify) and stop-dates (i.e. discharge). 2.2 Construct dataset First I will construct a test dataset to use in this chapter and subsequent ones. In this hypothetical I take a group of admissions that starts counting on 2000/01/01. Each entry will have a random exit up to 1000 days from entry, but censored at 2009/12/31 (because in my hypothetical example this is my study endpoint). Each entry will then have a random group classification (state), and event (0 or 1). The event will be assumed one per admission (E.g. death..). I didn’t allow for multiple admissions by person. I then generate the event as drawn from a random bernoulli distribution with probability \\(p_g\\) Where \\(g\\) is a group-specific effect randomly generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 0.3. set.seed(12345) #So you get same result sampsize = 20000 df &lt;- data.frame(id=1:sampsize, CohortEntry = sample(seq(as.Date(&#39;2000/01/01&#39;), as.Date(&#39;2009/12/31&#39;), by=&#39;day&#39;), replace=T, sampsize)) #CohortIn, CohortOut, Group df &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(CohortExit = CohortEntry+sample(0:365,sampsize, replace=T)) %&gt;% #CohortExit Date (up to 1000 days from start) mutate(State = sample(state.name, sampsize, replace=T)) #Random state for each group df$CohortExit &lt;- as.Date(sapply(df$CohortExit, function(x) min(x,as.Date(&#39;2009/12/31&#39;))), origin=origin) #Censor at &#39;study end&#39; #Group Effect State &lt;- as.data.frame(state.name) State$Effect &lt;- runif(50, min=0, max=0.3) #Random effect by group #Generate random event by group effect getReffect &lt;- function(df, group) { p &lt;- df[df$&#39;state.name&#39;==group,&quot;Effect&quot;] event = as.integer(rbernoulli(1, p = p)) return(event) } df$Event &lt;- sapply(df$id, function(x) getReffect(State, df$State[x])) #Generate random event #For more complicated procedures below, assign random event date between cohort start with event=0 to NA randomDate &lt;- function(TimeIn, TimeOut, Event) { RDate &lt;- sample(TimeIn:TimeOut, 1, replace=T) RDate &lt;- ifelse(Event==0,NA,RDate) return(RDate) } df$EventDate = sapply(df$id, function(x) randomDate(df$CohortEntry[x], df$CohortExit[x], df$Event[x])) df$EventDate = as.Date(df$EventDate, origin=origin) kable(head(df, n=10), align=c(&#39;c&#39;)) id CohortEntry CohortExit State Event EventDate 1 2007-03-18 2007-10-10 Ohio 0 NA 2 2008-10-04 2009-10-04 Rhode Island 0 NA 3 2007-08-11 2008-04-24 Ohio 0 NA 4 2008-11-11 2009-10-26 Nevada 0 NA 5 2004-07-25 2004-08-29 New York 0 NA 6 2001-08-30 2002-05-29 Alaska 1 2002-03-23 7 2003-04-02 2004-02-23 North Carolina 0 NA 8 2005-02-03 2005-10-02 Maine 0 NA 9 2007-04-12 2007-06-09 Nebraska 0 NA 10 2009-11-24 2009-12-31 Maine 0 NA 2.3 Show Data #Scatter and Fitted Line p1 &lt;- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=CohortEntry)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 4, fill=I(&quot;blue&quot;), alpha=I(0.4)) + geom_density(col=2) + xlab(&quot;Cohort Entry&quot;) + theme_bw() p2 &lt;- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=CohortExit)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 4, fill=I(&quot;blue&quot;), alpha=I(0.4)) + geom_density(col=2) + xlab(&quot;Cohort Exit&quot;) + theme_bw() grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow=1) A simple, even distribution to work with (cohort exit is even except for censored at study end date). 2.4 Reshape Process If you simply seek to count the total no. of records by groups this is simple. 2.4.1 Simple group counts dfState &lt;- df %&gt;% group_by(State) %&gt;% #Tells dplyr to create grouped object, and then execute following at that unit summarise(Records = n()) #count individuals cat(&quot;Counts of Records by State&quot;) ## Counts of Records by State kable(head(dfState, n=10), align=c(&#39;c&#39;)) State Records Alabama 396 Alaska 393 Arizona 393 Arkansas 385 California 372 Colorado 375 Connecticut 401 Delaware 399 Florida 376 Georgia 401 Also, if you wish to see the quantity of some event, this is easy also: 2.4.1.1 Simple Event Counts dfState &lt;- df %&gt;% group_by(State) %&gt;% #Tells dplyr to create grouped object, and then execute following at that unit summarise(Events = sum(Event)) #count no of events cat(&quot;Counts of Events by State&quot;) ## Counts of Events by State kable(head(dfState, n=10), align=c(&#39;c&#39;)) State Events Alabama 46 Alaska 26 Arizona 19 Arkansas 3 California 5 Colorado 84 Connecticut 61 Delaware 120 Florida 113 Georgia 59 If you wish to count records by time, this is still pretty easy, but you have to be more specific. For example, if I want to count the number of Cohort entries by year, this is how: 2.4.2 Cohort entries by year counts #First make year var df &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(EntryYear = year(CohortEntry)) #year function from lubridate #Second group by this var dfGroup &lt;- df %&gt;% group_by(EntryYear) %&gt;% summarise(Records = n(), Events = sum(Event)) #count individuals cat(&quot;Counts of Records by Cohort Entry Year&quot;) ## Counts of Records by Cohort Entry Year kable(head(dfGroup, n=10), align=c(&#39;c&#39;)) EntryYear Records Events 2000 2015 274 2001 1987 273 2002 2041 288 2003 1933 295 2004 2043 269 2005 2068 313 2006 1964 285 2007 2019 308 2008 1974 297 2009 1956 293 2.4.3 Cohort prevalence by time The next step will get a little trickier. Let’s say we aren’t interested in how many individuals entered/exited the cohort in a given year as above. Rather we want to identify how many total patients are in the cohort during a specified period of time (e.g. year). This is like “point prevalence”, in the sense that we are measuring the number of cohort individuals in a given time interval (point prevalence is usually the no. of diseased / total population). So we need to take the “CohortEntry”, “CohortExit” date variables and compute how many individuals were in the cohort in year 1, year 2 etc. What makes this tricky is that individuals don’t start and stop at the same time and cross multiple time units (years in this case). Here is one method where I compute the “prevalent”&quot; cohort, no. events and event rate: #Create New Dataframe by Time Unit TimeMin &lt;- min(year(df$CohortEntry)) #lowest time unit observed TimeMax &lt;- max(year(df$CohortExit)) #highest time unit observed #This following sequence step is good, in case a certain year was skipped (i.e. no admits that year) dfTime &lt;- TimeMin:TimeMax %&gt;% #Sequence years as_tibble() %&gt;% mutate(x2 = NA, x3 = NA) names(dfTime) &lt;- c(&quot;Year&quot;, &quot;Residents&quot;, &quot;Events&quot;) #Write a time-interval program for Residence (assuming x is year) InCohort &lt;- function(x, TimeIn, TimeOut) { #Note that the following line works because of R vectorization count &lt;- if_else(x&gt;=year(TimeIn) &amp; x&lt;=year(TimeOut),1,0) #Test if x is TimeIn&lt;=x&lt;=TimeOut InCohortN &lt;- sum(count) #Add up total people return(InCohortN) #return } #Write a time-interval program for Event InEvent &lt;- function(x, Event, EventDate) { #Note that the following line works because of R vectorization events &lt;- if_else(Event==1 &amp; x==year(EventDate),1,0) #Added condition of event==1 InCohortEvents &lt;- sum(events) #Add up total events in that year return(InCohortEvents) #return } dfTime$Residents &lt;- sapply(dfTime$Year, function(x) InCohort(x, df$CohortEntry,df$CohortExit)) dfTime$Events &lt;- sapply(dfTime$Year, function(x) InEvent(x, df$Event, df$EventDate)) dfTime$&#39;Event Rate&#39; &lt;- dfTime$Events / dfTime$Residents #Calculate events #eventnum &lt;- df %?% cat(&quot;No. of individuals in the cohort by year&quot;) ## No. of individuals in the cohort by year kable(head(dfTime, n=10), align=c(&#39;c&#39;), digits=3) Year Residents Events Event Rate 2000 2015 200 0.099 2001 2981 271 0.091 2002 3040 284 0.093 2003 2951 291 0.099 2004 3034 283 0.093 2005 3063 299 0.098 2006 2956 295 0.100 2007 2986 301 0.101 2008 2972 294 0.099 2009 2945 373 0.127 So because I didn’t specify a time-trend in my sample generation, it makes sense that the event rate is relatively constant over time. We can double-check this worked with the following specific code: #Logic # IF 2004 is less than or equal to EntryDate (i.e. they entered before or during 2004) # AND 2004 is less than or equal to Exit (i.e. they exited after or during 2004) Check &lt;- ifelse(2004&gt;=year(df$CohortEntry) &amp; 2004&lt;=year(df$CohortExit),1,0) cat(&quot;2004 people :&quot;, sum(Check)) ## 2004 people : 3034 2.4.4 Incidence Density df &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(TimeDiff = as.integer(CohortExit - CohortEntry)) #timeDiff "],

Like with many things, R has extensive flexibility here but can be daunting when you want a quick option. To bring this down to earth, I lay out the background, provide practical recommendations, user-written commands and benchmark to STATA. 3.1.1 Packages to use R version 3.3.2 (2016-10-31) Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 14393) attached base packages: [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets base other attached packages: [1] knitr_1.15.17 boot_1.3-18 lmtest_0.9-35 [4] zoo_1.7-14 sandwich_2.3-4 Scotty_0.0.0.9000 [7] devtools_1.12.0 Hmisc_4.0-2 Formula_1.2-1 [10] survival_2.41-2 lattice_0.20-35 dplyr_0.5.0 [13] purrr_0.2.2 readr_1.1.0 tidyr_0.6.1 [16] tibble_1.2 ggplot2_2.2.1 tidyverse_1.1.1 “Scotty” is my own package. “tidyverse” is Wickam et al. general suite of packages/commands to work with R. “Hmisc” is Frank Harrel’s miscellaneous commands, many of which are quite useful. “sandwich”, “lmtest” and “boot” are specifically relevant to this chapter in order to compute various standard errors (SE). 3.2 Test data To test and demonstrate code and assumptions are correct. I utilize the “PublicSchools” dataset in the “sandwich” package. This dataset is well-described in peer-reviewed research, and standard text books (Table 14.1 in Green [1993]).(Greene 1993, Zeileis (2004), Zeileis (2006), (“Cribari-Neto F” 2004)) The data comes originally from a 1979 report on per capita public school expenditures and per capita income by state from the U.S. Dept. of Commerce. ## Load public schools data, omit NA in Wisconsin, scale income and make squared Income term: data(PublicSchools) df &lt;- as_tibble(PublicSchools %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% mutate(Income = Income*1e-04)) %&gt;% mutate(Income2 = Income^2) head(df) ## # A tibble: 6 × 3 ## Expenditure Income Income2 ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 275 0.6247 0.3902501 ## 2 821 1.0851 1.1774420 ## 3 339 0.7374 0.5437588 ## 4 275 0.6183 0.3822949 ## 5 387 0.8850 0.7832250 ## 6 452 0.8001 0.6401600 se_results &lt;- as_tibble(matrix(nrow=4,ncol=6)) names(se_results) &lt;- c(&quot;method&quot;,&quot;vcov Matrix&quot;, &quot;Income_Beta&quot;,&quot;Income_SE&quot;,&quot;Income2_Beta&quot;,&quot;Income2_SE&quot;) method &lt;- c(&quot;manual&quot;,&quot;lm&quot;,&quot;manual&quot;,&quot;HC0&quot;) #,&quot;HC1&quot;,&quot;HC2&quot;,&quot;HC3&quot;,&quot;HC4&quot;) type &lt;- c(&quot;iid&quot;,&quot;iid&quot;,&quot;White&quot;,&quot;White (dfc)&quot;) for (i in 1:nrow(se_results)) { se_results[i,1] &lt;- method[i] se_results[i,2] &lt;- type[i] } 3.3 Linear Regression Model First, I start with the classical ordinary least squares framework. \\[y_i = X_i\\beta + u_{i} \\quad \\textrm{where} \\quad i = 1,..,n\\] Where \\(y\\) is a dependent variable, \\(X\\) is a vector of regressors (i.e. independent variables) with \\(k\\)-dimensions,\\(\\beta\\) is a vector of the coefficients for \\(X\\), and \\(u\\) is the residual error term. In matrix notation often simply as: \\(y= X\\beta+u\\). Under normal assumptions, the mean of \\(u_i\\) (that is the residual of a given observation \\(i\\)) should be zero and possess a constant variance across all subsets of \\(i\\). The second assumption is my focus here, which is often incorrect in empirical research. 3.4 Estimation of regression parameters and variance Typically in empirical research you are interested in estimating some or all parameter coefficients, and a measure of variance or precision on that parameter. With this most empiricists will make statement along the lines of “A 1-unit change in \\(x\\) produces a \\(\\beta\\)-unit change in \\(y\\), and a null hypothesis of \\(\\beta\\)=0 is rejected with 95% confidence”. In our example, assume we want to model per capita expenditures regressed on income. First, I demonstrate how to estimate your parameter coefficient, \\(\\beta_1\\) the coefficient on income and the square root of the variance, \\(\\sigma\\). 3.4.1 Manually computed beta parameters R basically computes the regression coefficients with the standard \\((\\textbf{X}&#39;\\textbf{X})^{-1}\\textbf{X}&#39;\\textbf{y}\\) i.e. the coefficient is a function of X and y. You can do this manually like so: Y = as.matrix(df$Expenditure) X = as.matrix(cbind(1,df$Income, df$Income2)) #Add one for intercept beta = solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% (t(X) %*% Y) rownames(beta) &lt;- c(&quot;Int&quot;,&quot;Income&quot;,&quot;Income2&quot;) colnames(beta) &lt;- c(&quot;Beta&quot;) se_results[1,3] &lt;- beta[2,1] se_results[1,5] &lt;- beta[3,1] se_results ## # A tibble: 4 × 6 ## method `vcov Matrix` Income_Beta Income_SE Income2_Beta Income2_SE ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 manual iid -1834.203 NA 1587.042 NA ## 2 lm iid NA NA NA NA ## 3 manual White NA NA NA NA ## 4 HC0 White (dfc) NA NA NA NA 3.4.2 Manually computed standard errors In a regression framework you compute standard errors by taking the square root of the diagonal elements of the variance-covariance matrix. As defined above, consider \\(u\\) is normally distributied with mean=0, and standard deviation, \\(\\sigma^2I\\). Where \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance. First, define the expectation of the variance of \\(\\beta\\) conditional on X. \\[\\textrm{Var}[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}}|\\textbf{X}] = (\\textbf{X}&#39;\\textbf{X})^{-1}(\\textbf{X}&#39; \\mathbf{\\sigma^2_{u}}\\mathbf{I}\\textbf{X}) (\\textbf{X}&#39;\\textbf{X})^{-1}\\] If you assume that \\(u\\) is indepedent (i.e. orthogonal) to \\(\\beta\\), and identically distributed across subpopulations of \\(\\beta\\). The variance of a random vector X and non-random matrix = matrix * Var(X) * matrix’, can be expressed as: \\[\\textrm{Var}[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}}|\\textbf{X}] = \\mathbf{\\sigma^2_{u}}(\\textbf{X}&#39;\\textbf{X})^{-1}\\] \\[E[{uu}&#39;|\\textbf{X}] = \\mathbf{\\Sigma_{u}}\\] Assuming \\(\\sigma_u^2\\) is fixed but unknown, a given random sample’s variance, \\(s^2\\), can be estimated: Equation 5. Standard Error \\[s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2}{n-k}\\] Where \\(e\\) are the squared residuals, \\(n\\) is the sample size, and \\(k\\) are the number of regressors. With this information the standard errors above can be replicated manually like so: Y = as.matrix(df$Expenditure) #Dependent variable X = as.matrix(cbind(1,df$Income, df$Income2)) #Design matrix, add one for intercept beta = solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% (t(X) %*% Y) #Solve for beta as above n &lt;- dim(X)[1] # number of obs k &lt;- dim(X)[2] # n of predictors # calculate stan errs as eq in the above SigmaSq &lt;- sum((Y - X%*%beta)^2)/(n-k) # (sum residuals)^2 / (degree of freedom correction) i.e. estimate of sigma-squared vcovMat &lt;- SigmaSq*chol2inv(chol(t(X)%*%X)) # variance covariance matrix StdErr &lt;- sqrt(diag(vcovMat)) #sq root of diagonal se_results[1,4] &lt;- StdErr[2] se_results[1,6] &lt;- StdErr[3] se_results ## # A tibble: 4 × 6 ## method `vcov Matrix` Income_Beta Income_SE Income2_Beta Income2_SE ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 manual iid -1834.203 828.9855 1587.042 519.0768 ## 2 lm iid NA NA NA NA ## 3 manual White NA NA NA NA ## 4 HC0 White (dfc) NA NA NA NA 3.4.3 R lm function To confirm the above we can compute the same with the the lm function m1 &lt;- lm(Expenditure ~ Income + Income2, data = df) se_results[2,3] &lt;- coeftest(m1)[2,1] se_results[2,4] &lt;- coeftest(m1)[2,2] se_results[2,5] &lt;- coeftest(m1)[3,1] se_results[2,6] &lt;- coeftest(m1)[3,2] se_results ## # A tibble: 4 × 6 ## method `vcov Matrix` Income_Beta Income_SE Income2_Beta Income2_SE ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 manual iid -1834.203 828.9855 1587.042 519.0768 ## 2 lm iid -1834.203 828.9855 1587.042 519.0768 ## 3 manual White NA NA NA NA ## 4 HC0 White (dfc) NA NA NA NA The estimates are identical. However the critical assumption here of \\(u\\) being “iid”, can often be wrong in empirical research. In the following, I broadly define these concepts. 3.5 Heteroskedascity Heteroskedascity in this context refers to a random variable where a given subset of a sample will have different variability compared with others. Variability being variance or some other measure of dispersion. In constrast homoskedascity is when variance is constant across these subpopulations (Figure 1). #Generate Data x &lt;- runif(500) yHomo &lt;- 2*x + rnorm(500) yHetero &lt;- 2*x + x*rnorm(500) df2 &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(x, yHomo, yHetero)) #Scatter and Fitted Line ggplot(data=df2, aes(x=x, y=yHomo)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=&#39;lm&#39;, se=F) + xlab(&quot;X variable&quot;) + theme_bw() Figure 1. Example of homoskedascity. Note how data points appear to be randomly scattered around line of best fit, and that the dispersion appears of the points constant across the range of X variable. #Scatter and Fitted Line ggplot(data=df2, aes(x=x, y=yHetero)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=&#39;lm&#39;, se=F) + xlab(&quot;X variable&quot;) + theme_bw() Figure 2. Example of heteroskedascity. See how the dispersion of the points appears greater as X increases. Under the assumption of independent and identically distributed errors (homoskedascity), Eq. 3 is simplified to eq. 4 (transpose matrix, using diagonal elements). 3.5.1 Heteroskedascity in income data #Scatter and Fitted Line ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Income, y=Expenditure)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=&#39;lm&#39;, formula=y ~ x + poly(x,2), se=F) + geom_smooth(method=&#39;lm&#39;, linetype=2, se=F) + xlab(&quot;Income&quot;) + theme_bw() ## Warning in predict.lm(model, newdata = data.frame(x = xseq), se.fit = se, : ## prediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading In our “real-world” small sample of data a visual representation of data can be challenging to draw conclusions from. We see there is an outlier (“Alaska”). However, it is difficult to judge overall dispersion with either a squared term [solid line] or a linear term [dashed line]. 3.6 “White” heteroskedastic consistent errors In the setting of heteroskedascity, the parameters are consistent but inefficient and also the variance-covariance matrix is inconsistent (i.e. biased).(White 1980) The assumption of the residuals \\(u\\) being identically distributed does not hold, and the diagonal matrix is invalid. However, an alternative variance-covariance matrix can be computed which is heteroskedastic consistent.(White 1980) With the “robust” approach proposed by White et al., you assume the variance of the residual is estimated as a diagonal matrix of each squared residual (vs. average above with \\(s^2\\)). Each j-th row-column element is \\(\\hat{u}_{j}^{2}\\) in the diagonal terms of \\({\\Sigma_{u}}\\).

It is not technically the same as the White paper because STATA does a degree of freedom adjustment for small sample size. 3.6.2 R standard function Using the already written commands you can specify “White” standard errors with the vcovHC function in the sandwich package.(Zeileis 2006) You can report correct standard errors like below with vcovHC option in function coeftest. vcovHC has several types available. The general formula for the var-cov matrix is: \\((X&#39;X)^{-1} X&#39; Omega X (X&#39;X)^{-1}\\). The specification of \\(Omega\\) is determined by the type= option. type=&quot;cons&quot; \\(\\omega_i = \\sigma^2\\) Constant variance type=HC0 \\(\\omega_i = \\mu^2_i\\) the White variance-covariance matrix type=HC1 \\(\\omega_i = \\frac{n}{n-k}\\mu^2_i\\) Small sample correction (STATA). type=HC2 \\(\\omega_i = \\frac{\\mu^2_i}{1-h_i}\\) type=HC3 \\(\\omega_i = \\frac{\\mu^2_i}{(1-h_i)^{2}}\\) type=HC4 \\(\\omega_i = \\frac{\\mu^2_i}{(1-h_i)^{\\delta_i}}\\) Where \\(h_i = H_{ii}\\) are the diagonal elements of the hat matrix and \\(\\delta_i = min({4 }, {h_i}{h¯})\\). The documentation for the sandwich package recommends HC4 based on recent literature.(“Cribari-Neto F” 2004) ## Different variance-covariance options with vcovHC ## type = cons ## ## t test of coefficients: ## ## Estimate Std.

Like with many things, R has extensive flexibility here but can be daunting when you want a quick option. To bring this flexibility down to earth, I lay out the background, provide practical recommendations, user-written commands and benchmark to STATA. 4.1.1 Packages to use R version 3.3.2 (2016-10-31) Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 14393) attached base packages: [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets base other attached packages: [1] Scotty_0.0.0.9000 Hmisc_4.0-2 Formula_1.2-1 [4] survival_2.41-2 lattice_0.20-35 dplyr_0.5.0 [7] purrr_0.2.2 readr_1.1.0 tidyr_0.6.1 [10] tibble_1.2 ggplot2_2.2.1 tidyverse_1.1.1 “Scotty” is my own package. “tidyverse” is Wickam et al. general suite of packages/commands to work with R. “Hmisc” is Frank Harrel’s miscellaneous commands, many of which are quite useful. 4.2 Clustering 4.3 Cluster robust errors in R 4.4 Block bootstrapping An alternative to computing a special variance-covariance matrix is using a non-parametric “brute-force” method termed block bootstrapping. To do this, you the sample the dataset with replacement by group or “block” instead of individual observation. The parameters are estimated for each sample instance and stored in a new table. Then, you can either compute the parameter moments (mean, variance etc.) using the stored coefficients or if a 95% parameter interval is the ultimate goal one can simply report the ordered percentiles (e.g., 2.5% - 97.5%). Other methods for computing the intervals exist, such as bias-corrected. Whichever you pick, bootstraps are about as unbiased as the above sandwich estimators, and may be advantageous when the number of clusters is small. 4.5 Permutation or “Randomization” Test 4.5.1 Bootstrap Program Boot.ATE &lt;- function (model, treat, R = 250, block = &quot;&quot;, df) { require(boot) require(dplyr) family &lt;- model$family if (block == &quot;&quot;) { boot.mod &lt;- function(x, i, model, treat) { samp.df &lt;- x[i, ] samp.glm &lt;- try(glm(model, data = samp.df, family = family)) if (inherits(samp.glm, &quot;try-error&quot;)) { coef &lt;- NA ate &lt;- NA rr &lt;- NA c(coef, ate, rr) } else { df2 &lt;- samp.df df2[, paste(treat)] = 1 pred1. &lt;- predict.glm(samp.glm, newdata = df2, type = &quot;response&quot;) df2[, paste(treat)] = 0 pred0. &lt;- predict.glm(samp.glm, newdata = df2, type = &quot;response&quot;) coef &lt;- samp.glm$coefficients[paste0(treat)] ate &lt;- mean(pred1.) -
